Here are some viva questions and answers based on the practicals from your **Business Intelligence and Data Analytics (BIDA) Practical** document:

---

### **1. Importing Data Warehouse Data in Microsoft Excel and Creating Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts**
**Q1:** What is a Pivot Table in Excel?  
**A1:** A Pivot Table is a data summarization tool that allows users to organize, analyze, and present data dynamically by grouping, filtering, and calculating values such as sums and averages.

**Q2:** How do you create a Pivot Table in Excel?  
**A2:** Steps to create a Pivot Table:  
1. Select the dataset.  
2. Click on the **Insert** tab and select **Pivot Table**.  
3. Choose the data range and where to place the table.  
4. Select fields to display in rows, columns, and values.

**Q3:** What is a Pivot Chart?  
**A3:** A Pivot Chart is a graphical representation of a Pivot Table that updates automatically when the underlying Pivot Table changes.

### **2. What-If Analysis in Excel**
**Q4:** What is What-If Analysis?  
**A4:** What-If Analysis is a feature in Excel that allows users to experiment with different input values to see how they affect the output without modifying the original dataset.

**Q5:** Name the three tools in What-If Analysis.  
**A5:**  
1. **Goal Seek** â€“ Finds the required input value for a desired output.  
2. **Scenario Manager** â€“ Saves multiple sets of input values and compares results.  
3. **Data Table** â€“ Analyzes how changing input variables affect an output formula.

**Q6:** How does Goal Seek work?  
**A6:** Goal Seek adjusts a specific input value to achieve a target result in a formula.

### **3. Data Classification Using R/Python**
**Q7:** What is Classification in Machine Learning?  
**A7:** Classification is a supervised learning technique that categorizes data into predefined classes or labels.

**Q8:** What are common classification algorithms?  
**A8:**  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forest  
- NaÃ¯ve Bayes  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

**Q9:** What library is used for classification in R?  
**A9:** `party` and `rpart` are commonly used libraries for classification in R.

---

### **4. Data Clustering Using R/Python**
**Q10:** What is Clustering in Data Analytics?  
**A10:** Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together based on certain characteristics.

**Q11:** Name two clustering algorithms.  
**A11:**  
- **K-Means Clustering**  
- **Hierarchical Clustering**

**Q12:** What is the key difference between classification and clustering?  
**A12:** Classification assigns labels to data points based on predefined categories, whereas clustering groups data points without predefined labels.

---

### **5. Linear Regression in R/Python**
**Q13:** What is Linear Regression?  
**A13:** Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

**Q14:** What function is used for Linear Regression in R?  
**A14:** `lm()` function.

**Q15:** What is the equation of a simple linear regression model?  
**A15:** \( Y = mX + C \) (where \( Y \) is the dependent variable, \( X \) is the independent variable, \( m \) is the slope, and \( C \) is the intercept).

---

### **6. Logistic Regression in R/Python**
**Q16:** What is Logistic Regression?  
**A16:** Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes (Yes/No, 0/1).

**Q17:** What is the key difference between Linear and Logistic Regression?  
**A17:** Linear Regression predicts continuous values, while Logistic Regression predicts categorical outcomes.

**Q18:** What function is used for Logistic Regression in R?  
**A18:** `glm()` function with `family=binomial`.

---

### **7. Python Program for Data Analysis Using Pandas**
**Q19:** What is Pandas in Python?  
**A19:** Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.

**Q20:** How do you read a CSV file using Pandas?  
**A20:** `pd.read_csv("filename.csv")`

**Q21:** How do you create a scatter plot using Matplotlib?  
**A21:**  
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(data['x_column'], data['y_column'])
plt.show()
```

---

### **8. Data Visualization Using Python**
**Q22:** What are common data visualization libraries in Python?  
**A22:**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**  
- **Plotly**  

**Q23:** How do you generate a scatter plot in Python?  
**A23:**  
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(df['Duration'], df['Calories'])
plt.show()
```

---

### **9. Data Visualization Using Power BI**
**Q24:** What is Power BI?  
**A24:** Power BI is a data visualization and business intelligence tool developed by Microsoft.

**Q25:** How do you import data into Power BI?  
**A25:**  
1. Open Power BI Desktop.  
2. Click **Get Data** â†’ **Excel Workbook**.  
3. Select the file and click **Load**.
